Trevor Lewis - Ramsey Junior Front End Engineer Challenge

My experience:

    This was a doozy. I've been stuck in my ways of using React for building applications, so I had to re-teach(and teach) myself a few things. 

    I have never used JQuery before this challenge. I did a little research and decided it would benefit under the time constraint if I used it. During the four hours I was learning as fast as I could to understand the best utilization to get the functionality in place.

    I approached this by building out the UI/UX first, then applying JQuery to meet the specifications. If it was not for me stumbling on a new technology, I know I would've been able to apply those sweet animations to the navigation, and matching content. 

    It was incredibly fun picking up a new technology while completeing this challenge.
